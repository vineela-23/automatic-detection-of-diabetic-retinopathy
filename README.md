# automaticdetectionof_retinopathy
CNN-based medical image classification system for automated diabetic retinopathy detection with 98% accuracy.
Automatic Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy using CNN

This project focuses on building an end-to-end deep learning system to automatically detect and classify diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model analyzes medical images to identify disease stages, supporting early diagnosis and timely treatment.

The system includes image preprocessing, data augmentation, model training, validation, and multi-class classification to improve accuracy and generalization. The trained CNN achieved 98% classification accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating reliable performance in medical image analysis.
